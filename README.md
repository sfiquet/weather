# weather

This is my implementation of FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate Front-End Development Project "Show the Local Weather".

It's an app that allows the user to check the current weather in any city in the world, or at the user's current location with geolocation. The source for the weather data is FreeCodeCamp's own Weather API.
